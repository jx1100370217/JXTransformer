1929   or   1989 ?
PARIS   –   As   the   economic   crisis   deepens   and   widens ,   the   world   has   been   searching   for   historical   analogies   to   help   us   understand   what   has   been   happening .
At   the   start   of   the   crisis ,   many   people   likened   it   to   1982   or   1973 ,   which   was   reassuring ,   because   both   dates   refer   to   classical   cyclical   downturns .
Today ,   the   mood   is   much   grimmer ,   with   references   to   1929   and   1931   beginning   to   abound ,   even   if   some   governments   continue   to   behave   as   if   the   crisis   was   more   classical   than   exceptional .
The   tendency   is   either   excessive   restraint   ( Europe )   or   a   diffusion   of   the   effort   ( the   United   States ) .
Europe   is   being   cautious   in   the   name   of   avoiding   debt   and   defending   the   euro ,   whereas   the   US   has   moved   on   many   fronts   in   order   not   to   waste   an   ideal   opportunity   to   implement   badly   needed   structural   reforms .
For   geo - strategists ,   however ,   the   year   that   naturally   comes   to   mind ,   in   both   politics   and   economics ,   is   1989 .
Of   course ,   the   fall   of   the   house   of   Lehman   Brothers   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   fall   of   the   Berlin   Wall .
Indeed ,   on   the   surface   it   seems   to   be   its   perfect   antithesis :   the   collapse   of   a   wall   symbolizing   oppression   and   artificial   divisions   versus   the   collapse   of   a   seemingly   indestructible   and   reassuring   institution   of   financial   capitalism .
